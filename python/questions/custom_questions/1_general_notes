General notes when coding in interview

1. Use triple ''' to be a notes section
"""
Notes
"""

2. use v ^ to denote an index in a list
 v
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
   ^

3. Briefly talk about the brute force / naive solution. Explain why its bad, and then go to a better solution.

4. write test cases by comparing result to what you expect
print(two_sum(input) == 5)

5. keep track of edge cases ( in test cases)

6. Try to think of Time complexity and space complexity before implementation
Time:
Space:

7. Premeditation before implementation. Even if solution is not correct
Pseudo code can be useful!
