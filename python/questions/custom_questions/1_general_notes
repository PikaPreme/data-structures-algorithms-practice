General notes when coding in interview

1. Premeditation before implementation. Even if solution is not correct
START WITH PSEUDO CODE!

2. Try to think of Time complexity and space complexity before implementation
Time:
Space:

3. Briefly talk about the brute force / naive solution. Explain why its bad, and then go to a better solution.

4. keep track of edge cases ( in test cases)

5. write test cases by comparing result to what you expect
print(two_sum(input) == 5)

6. Use triple ''' to be a notes section
"""
Notes
"""

7. use v ^ to denote an index in a list
 v
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
   ^

8. If the question is hard, and you can maybe think of the naive solution (n^2).
Say that you'll start with that and maybe afterwards you might have more insight
 on the problem and see if there is a better way to implement.
